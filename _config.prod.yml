# Service worker
# Features:
# - allows for offline access
# - enables preloading of URLs for near-instant loading of pages
#
# Our service worker is network-or-cache. It means it always tries to load
# resources from the network when possible. Only in case response is slow or not
# coming at all, cache is tried.

    enabled: true
    # Cache version needs to be increased when service worker implementations
    # needs to be changed. It's basically one of following scenarios:
    #
    # - new (more clever) service worker implementation
    # - list of precached URLs changes - this is ESCPECIALLY TRUE FOR /offline/
    #   fallback pages as it's only loaded when new service worker is released and never again.
    #
    # Anyway, service worker will only be updated when all browser tabs are
    # closed due to various reasons.
    # See https://redfin.engineering/draft-service-workers-break-the-refresh-button-by-default-56f9417694 if unsure.
