We originally thought it would be used to print out parts for drones and other toys, like for special tracks for Legos. It was a lot of fun! But in addition to having fun, we also found out that our printer—like the vast majority of FFF printers—didn’t have a network connection, which meant we had to constantly walk over to it with an SD card. And this is where our aversion to doing unnecessary work comes in—as well as the programmers’ faith that there’s always a simpler way to do things.",

We were greatly helped in this by <arenaLink>3D aréna</arenaLink> and <ikemLink>Prague’s Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM)</ikemLink>, where they print real copies of transplanted organs. We also found out that Karmen has huge added value for schools and co-working spaces. It’s very popular in companies because it enables simple connections between departments where print materials are prepared and branches where the printer is physically present. These don’t have to be in the same building, or even on the same continent.",
